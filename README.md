This includes:
  - Home Page
  - My College Football Recruiting Project
    - Sortable Historical Recruits Data
      ==> This was my first project page, utilizing a backend python-built  webscraper using Selenium which could scrape college football recruiting websites for public historical data which was not displated anywhere else, so recruits could be compared by recruiting service for historical data, which was not available anywhere online before. During this segment, I became more proficient in Python, HTML/CSS, front-end Javascript, React, React hooks and event listeners, and an understanding of the importance of being a full-stack engineer.
    - TBD: Build Your Own Composite
      ==> This page was a deeper dive into understanding front-end Javascript and user page interaction, as well as some small attempts at UI/UX development. This was important for the site because it is a feature that can provide an unbiased composite recruiting score to high school athletes where users can choose their own weights for each recruiting services ranking, unlike the biased composite scores given by each service separately.
